            <p>Poitier did not want to shoot the film in Mississippi because he had been harassed by the Ku Klux Klan
                when
                he
                had visited there with Harry Belafonte at the height of the civil rights movement in 1964, so most of it
                was
                filmed in Sparta, Illinois. Filmmakers even changed the name of the fictional Mississippi town in the
                movie
                to
                Sparta so they wouldn’t have to pay to have the town’s water tower repainted.</p>

                <p>After Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), the very first Muslims were people from his own circle of family and
                    friends as well as the poor and needy in Mecca more than 1400 years ago. During the life of Muhammad
                    (pbuh), this small band of followers grew by tens of thousands. As centuries passed, Muslims have
                    only
                    grown in number. Today, Muslims account for about one quarter of the entire world population.</p>

                    A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client–server
                    model.
                    The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET, Python,
                    Node.js, Go
                    or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server.
