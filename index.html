            <p>Poitier did not want to shoot the film in Mississippi because he had been harassed by the Ku Klux Klan
                when
                he
                had visited there with Harry Belafonte at the height of the civil rights movement in 1964, so most of it
                was
                filmed in Sparta, Illinois. Filmmakers even changed the name of the fictional Mississippi town in the
                movie
                to
                Sparta so they wouldn’t have to pay to have the town’s water tower repainted.</p>
